Usage:
  syncthing [options]

  -log-max-old-files="3"    Number of old files to keep (zero to keep only current).
  -log-max-size="10485760"  Maximum size of any file (zero to disable log rotation).
  -logfile="-"              Log file name (still always logs to stdout). Cannot be used together with -no-restart/STNORESTART environment variable.
  -logflags="2"             Select information in log line prefix (see below)
  -no-browser               Do not start browser
  -no-restart               Disable monitor process, managed restarts and log file writing
  -paths                    Show configuration paths
  -paused                   Start with all devices and folders paused
              Reset the database, forcing a full rescan and resync
  -reset-deltas             Reset delta index IDs, forcing a full index exchange
  -unpaused                 Start with all devices and folders unpaused
  -upgrade                  Perform upgrade
  -upgrade-check            Check for available upgrade
  -upgrade-to=""            Force upgrade directly from specified URL
  -verbose                  Print verbose log output
  -version                  Show version


The -logflags value is a sum of the following:

   1  Date
   2  Time
   4  Microsecond time
   8  Long filename
  16  Short filename

I.e. to prefix each log line with date and time, set -logflags=3 (1 + 2 from
above). The value 0 is used to disable all of the above. The default is to
show time only (2).


Development Settings
--------------------

The following environment variables modify Syncthing's behavior in ways that
are mostly useful for developers. Use with care.

 STNODEFAULTFOLDER Don't create a default folder when starting for the first
                   time. This variable will be ignored anytime after the first
                   run.

 STGUIASSETS       Directory to load GUI assets from. Overrides compiled in
                   assets.

 STTRACE           A comma separated string of facilities to trace. The valid
                   facility strings listed below.

 STPROFILER        Set to a listen address such as "127.0.0.1:9090" to start
                   the profiler with HTTP access.

 STCPUPROFILE      Write a CPU profile to cpu-$pid.pprof on exit.

 STHEAPPROFILE     Write heap profiles to heap-$pid-$timestamp.pprof each time
                   heap usage increases.

 STBLOCKPROFILE    Write block profiles to block-$pid-$timestamp.pprof every 20
                   seconds.

 STPERFSTATS       Write running performance statistics to perf-$pid.csv. Not
                   supported on Windows.

 STDEADLOCKTIMEOUT Used for debugging internal deadlocks; sets debug
                   sensitivity. Use only under direction of a developer.

 STLOCKTHRESHOLD   Used for debugging internal deadlocks; sets debug
                   sensitivity.  Use only under direction of a developer.

 STNORESTART       Equivalent to the -no-restart argument. Disable the
                   Syncthing monitor process which handles restarts for some
                   configuration changes, upgrades, crashes and also log file
                   writing (stdout is still written).

 STNOUPGRADE       Disable automatic upgrades.

 STHASHING         Select the SHA256 hashing package to use. Possible values
                   are "standard" for the Go standard library implementation,
                   "minio" for the github.com/minio/sha256-simd implementation,
                   and blank (the default) for auto detection.

 STRECHECKDBEVERY  Set to a time interval to override the default database
                   check interval of 30 days (720h). The interval understands
                   "h", "m" and "s" abbreviations for hours minutes and seconds.
                   Valid values are like "720h", "30s", etc.

 GOMAXPROCS        Set the maximum number of CPU cores to use. Defaults to all
                   available CPU cores.

 GOGC              Percentage of heap growth at which to trigger GC. Default is
                   100. Lower numbers keep peak memory usage down, at the price
                   of CPU usage (i.e. performance).
